# FaceDetection:

It is a custom object detection model as well as real-time detection using OpenCV which can be used to detect anything by changing the input data to what suits you and apply several data augmentation techniques using Albumentations library. However, the data used here was used for face detection. (Done by: Tensorflow, Python3, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Albumentations)

This error only appeared because I was using paperspace (mainly for the gpu) so that's why It was not able to reach my web cam. However if you save the model and download it on your pc then you loaded the model in jupyter notebook and copy pasted the code for real-time detection, it will work and the output should look similar to the following image.
